     title:" Single Number"  
     desc:"Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
     You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space."
     input:
         [2,2,1]  exp_out: 1
         [4,1,2,1,2] exp_out: 4
         [1] exp_out:1
